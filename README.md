# Overview

Our application aims at curbing the habit of impulsive shopping by helping the user plan his/her shopping. The application keeps track what impulse buys the user has done, provides nudges (in the form of notification/alerts) and rewards the user when he returns any item marked as a binge purchase. Below is a brief summary for our application's journey through the various iterations:

### P6
We implemented the html pages for login, budget history and dashboard, the javascript functions to be added in subsequent iterations.

### P7
We implemented the pages for new budget and binge list. It basically solidified the structure we had to follow for the rest of the project but still required improvements in terms of design and functionalities.

### P8
Alerts and post purchase evaluation page was added. We incorporated a bunch of fine-grained changes in how the page interacted with the user based on the inputs given by our peers

### P9
This iteration was about perfecting style and improvements according to the discussions and usability testing done in the studio sessions.
